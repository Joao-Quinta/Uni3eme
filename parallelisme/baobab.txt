and then input password


GUIDE TO COMPILE IN BAOBAB -> 

(1) create c++ file in your computer, or in baobab
(2) copy it into your baobab by running line :
  	scp fileName.cpp costadj7@baobab2.hpc.unige.ch:/home/users/c/costadj7/scratch
(3) run this command to compile your cpp code:
	mpiCC hello.cpp -o hello -std=c++11
(4) make a batchfile.sh with the code to execute the job, to get this code:
  	https://baobabmaster.unige.ch/iface
(5) copy code into file, this can be done using VIM:
  	see this site for a quick guide VIM commands :
     		https://www.howtoforge.com/vim-basics
(6) sbatch batchfile.sh -> to submite the execution into baobab

TO CHECK JOB: squeue -u costadj7 (username)
IF JOB DONE: we will have a output file in the folder we are in


IMPORTANT NOTES : to execute in baobab, we need to also compile in baobab, compiling locally and copying the fito to baobab won't work!




copier depuis baobab:
	scp costadj7@baobab2.hpc.unige.ch:/home/users/c/costadj7/scratch outBcast1.out
